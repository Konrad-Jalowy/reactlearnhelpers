# reactlearnhelpers


Just some side project. I will be doing some learning helpers here using React.

First project: I want to copy paste some words from PDF file with their formatting into textarea. I want to create json file to be downloaded by this application. </br>
Then, another application will load this file and create simple guessing mechanism in which i see the word appear, then, upon click, its meaning. </br>
There will be many projects like this, that really help me to learn for completely non it-related exams i take. Real cases, real projects that i intend to use, not only show in my github... </br>

## Words learning help
- Related projects: text-to-file-app and show-words
- You open PDF presentation with words and their meanings/definitions as unordered list
- You copy-paste to text-to-file-app
- You enter the title
- You manually add or remove some words if you prefer
- Json file is created and you can download it (no backend needed)
- You open show-words app
- You upload json file (no backend needed, again, its client side file reader used)
- You specify what should go first (word or definition?)
- You specify how many words to take 
- You speficy if you want words to be shuffled
- You get something like powerpoint presentation... you see word, click again, you see definition, click again, next word only...
- Its nice project helping me to learn some stuff in real life
- CSS needs some improvements, on the other hand animated transitions are nice (but maybe theres some library out there that does that for you...)
- It will be improved in time (also another project are coming)
