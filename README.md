# reactlearnhelpers


Just some side project. I will be doing some learning helpers here using React.

First project: I want to copy paste some words from PDF file with their formatting into textarea. I want to create json file to be downloaded by this application. </br>
Then, another application will load this file and create simple guessing mechanism in which i see the word appear, then, upon click, its meaning. </br>
There will be many projects like this, that really help me to learn for completely non it-related exams i take. Real cases, real projects that i intend to use, not only show in my github...
